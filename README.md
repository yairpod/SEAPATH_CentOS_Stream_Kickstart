## Customization
Since the kickstart file defines installation parameters and each installation setup is different customization is recommended, Moreover since it includes local passwords and ssh keys some items are mendatory.


### Mandatory
**change the authorized_keys files (user and root) with your own**
Edit the seapath_kickstart.ks file and change the lines:
```
sshkey --username=virtu "ssh-rsa XXX"
sshkey --username=ansible "ssh-rsa XXX"
sshkey --username=root "ssh-rsa XXX"
```
Replacing the quoted section with the ssh key of your choose.

Replace [rootpw](https://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kickstart-docs.html#rootpw) with encrypted root password.

In the lines beginning with `user` change the value of `--password=` to [encrypted passwords](https://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kickstart-docs.html#user) of your choose.

**Depending on your network configuration**
Replace network device, ip and gateway and the `network` line.

**Depending on your Disk configuration**
Replace The installation disk device in lines:
```
ignoredisk --only-use=/dev/sda
part pv.0 --fstype=lvmpv --ondisk=/dev/sda  --size=20992
part /boot/efi --fstype=efi --ondisk=/dev/sda --size=512 --asprimary
```
Remove the line starting with `ignoredisk` if you wish to install on more then one disk.
